# Customer_churn-Analysis-EDA
This project analyzes telecom customer churn using EDA to find factors behind service discontinuation. Visuals like count plots, box plots, histograms, and stacked bar charts reveal that senior citizens, monthly contracts, fiber optic users, and lack of support services lead to higher churn.
